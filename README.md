**Rationale**

With the ever increasing popularity of and interest in cryptocurrency, there are still a vast amount of people who are sceptical or unsure as to whether they should invest in it or not.
Such people need an app that is easy to understand, simple to use and gives them clear visual feedback as to how their investment is progressing.  All of these should take place in a risk-free environment.

Hashmoney meets such needs by providing them with the ability to trade and track some of the most popular crypotcurrencies without any financial investment. Having registered, users are given 100,000 USD 'credits' which they can spend on a selection of cryptocurrencies as they please.  

All of the prices are up-to-the-minute accurate and taken from coinmarketcap.com via an api. Users can track the progress of their portfolio and can buy, sell and exchange cryptocurrencies as often as they wish.  There is also the option to reset their account and start from scratch.

The typical user for the website would be someone who:
* Is completely new to crypto and just wants to follow the prices
* Is unsure about trading crypto and wants to try it for fun
* Is risk-averse and wants to see how much they could make without any financial investment
* Knows about cryptocurrencies but can't afford to invest their own money just yet
* Wants an imaginary crypto portfolio to show their friend/partner/client the risks/benefits of investing

People visiting this website are looking for:
* Increased knowledge of trading cryptocurrencies
* A quick, easy way to invest in crytocurrencies risk-free
* The potential profits/losses which could be made in the short and long-term
* An introduction to cryptocurrencies

Hashmoney is the ideal site for such people because:
* It includes all of the above in one place
* It has intuitive controls and layout
* It is both clear and concise in its layout
* The information it provides is kept to a minimum to avoid cognitive overload

## UX

**Strategy**

User needs:  simple to navigate, quick to register, straightforward to trade, intuitive design, unintimidating and modern appearance.

Being a cryptocurrency trader myself, I remember the uncertainty and scepticism I had before I began. With that in mind, I decided to write an app that would enable people to dip into cryptocurrency trading risk-free. Along with that, I wanted it to be straightforward with clear feedback as to how their portfolio was growing (or not, as the case may be). I also wanted to give people the confidence to be able to make mistakes and to start from scratch again without financial penalties, hence the 'reset portfolio' option.


**Scope**

User Stories:
1. As someone who is new to cryptocurrency trading, I want an app which gives me clear and concise information.
2. As someone who is new to cryptocurrency trading, I want an app which is intuitive to use.
3. As a person who is risk-averse, I want an app that allows me to trade cryptocurrencies without any financial investment.
4. As a person who wants to invest in cryptocurrencies, but still has reservations, I want an app that shows me the realistic gains and losses that can be made.


**Structure**

To make sure the content/functionality is intuitive to navigate, I maintained consistency throughout the different pages by using the same layout/structure (landing page sections matched the order of menu items) and header and footer elements.

On the landing and gallery pages, I used content hinting so that users would be encouraged to scroll further down the page.

**Skeleton**

To make sure the app is intuitive to navigate and use, I decided to keep all of the buttons options fairly centrally placed and slightly to the right-hand side. This is very important for mobile users they are predominantly right-handed and allows for one-handed operation of the app. By minimizing the amount of visual content past the landing page, I also reduced distraction and maximized engagement.

**Surface**

The 'Monserrat' Google font was chosen to give a clean and modern feel, while the white/grey/blue colour scheme added to this style.

The colour scheme was chosen as it feels sharp and modern to match the world of cryptocurrencies. At the same time, it is both visually unintimidating and easy on the eye. I wanted the app to have this look so that it appeals to users who are risk-averse and who don't want to be overloaded with unecessary information. A shade of blue was chosen for the buttons as it is perceived as being a trustworthy,dependable, and responsible color. Blue is also popular among financial institutions, as conveys trust and stability. The button color is consistent throughout the app to maintain consistency and increase intuitivity.

The cryptocoin hero image was chosen for the landing page to make it immediately apparent that this is a financial app dealing with cryptocurrency. The large two sentence message underneath the hero image was used to give a clear, unambiguous description of what the app is about.

The cryptocoin images used in the title bars of all other pages were used to maintain consistency and also reaffirm that it is an app dealing with cryptocurrency.

**Testing Responsiveness**

![Responsiveness](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/assets/images/gameplay_screenshots.png "Responsiveness")

The website was tested on various screen sizes using Chrome DevTools, from iPhone5 up to 5k screen. The image above shows the website on iPhone 5, iPad and laptop screens. The app renders as per the screenshot below on a 5k screen resolution.

![5k](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/assets/images/5k_responsiveness.png "5k")

**Testing Browser Compatibility**

The website was successfully opened and rendered correctly in Chrome (both desktop and mobile versions), Edge and Safari.

**Code Validation**

The Python code from the app.py file was checked using [Pep8online](https://www.pep8online.com)

The first check brought back numerous errors which were all rectified and resulted with a clear check as per the screenshot below.

![IF ERROR](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/static/images/readme/marquee_error.png "IF ERROR")

Both the HTML and CSS were validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. This was done using the 'Validate by Direct Input' option. For the HTML, this resulted in an error with IF ERROR (see screenshot above). This was rectified by IF FIXED .  Final checks were done resulting in no errors as per screenshot below.

**Notable bug fixes**

1. Portfolio Balance Bug 

In an early version of the app, the portfolio screen was showing a balance which multiplied the USD amount by twenty. This resulted in an incorrect balance. Having examined the code within the app.py file, I discovered that there was an error within the loop that iterates through a user's currency balances to produce the total balance (see screenshots below). By moving the totalBalance variable outside of the else statement (but still within the loop), the bug was fixed. In the screenshots, the left image is with the bug and the right image is after the fix had been applied. Line numbers are different from what they are in the final version as much more code has been added.

5. Heroku Deployment Bug

![Heroku Bug](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/static/images/readme/heroku_app_error.png "Heroku Bug")

With the app not far from completion, I attempted to deploy it with Heroku. When trying to run the app, it produced the error is per the screenshot above. Having followed the onscreen instructions, I took a look at the application logs (shown below) and determined the error lay with importing requests. Having tried numerous suggestions from various webpages (which included freezing the requirements file) without success, I turned to tutor support for help. They also struggled, but suggested typing 'requests' directly into the requirements.txt file (no version number required - see second image below). Having done this and then re-deplying on Heroku again, the app ran as expected.

## Deployment 

**Deploying to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)**

* Go to your Gitpod CLI and create a requirements file by typing 'pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt' in the root directory.
* Next, create the Procfile by typing 'echo web: python app.py > Procfile' into the CLI root directory.
* Open this new file and type the line 'web: python3 app.py'. Make sure you delete any blank lines at the bottom, then save the file.
* Add, commit and push your newly created files to your Github repository.
* Then, go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and create an account. 
* After logging in, click on 'create new app'.
* Select the closest region to your location and give the app a name.
* Select 'GitHub' as the deployment method.
* Within the GitHub profile, enter the name of the GitHub repository you want to deploy from and click 'search'.
* Once Heroku has found the repository, click to connect the app.
* Next, you will need to login to your [MongoDB Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) account.
* Once in, select your databse cluster on the dashboard then click 'connect'.
* Then select 'connection your application' and copy the connection string from the 'connection string only' tab.
* You then need to login to your [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) account.
* From the dashboard, copy the API key.
* Next, navigate back to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), go to the 'settings' tab for the app and click 'Reveal Config Vars'.
* Now set the environment variables by entering key:value pairs (leaving out any inverted commas) so that they match those in your env.py file:

|  Key                  | Value        |

Adding files to the Github repository is done as follows:

Type the following into the command line:

        git add .  
        git commit -m "this is what I have done"
        git push

Using the '.' will add all files to the repository staging area. Single files are added using file path names, i.e.: about.html or assets/images/hero.png.
