**Rationale**

With the ever increasing popularity of and interest in cryptocurrency, there are still a vast amount of people who are skeptical or unsure as to whether they should invest in it or not.
Such people need an app that is easy to understand, simple to use and gives them clear visual feedback as to how their investment is progressing.  All of these should take place in a risk-free environment.

Hashmoney meets such needs by providing them with the ability to trade and track some of the most popular cryptocurrencies without any financial investment. Having registered, users are given 100,000 USD 'credits' which they can spend on a selection of cryptocurrencies as they please.  

All of the prices are up-to-the-minute accurate and taken from coinmarketcap.com via an api. Users can track the progress of their portfolio and can buy, sell and exchange cryptocurrencies as often as they wish.  There is also the option to reset their account and start from scratch.

The typical user for the website would be someone who:
* Is completely new to crypto and just wants to follow the prices
* Is unsure about trading crypto and wants to try it for fun
* Is risk-averse and wants to see how much they could make without any financial investment
* Knows about cryptocurrencies but can't afford to invest their own money just yet
* Wants an imaginary crypto portfolio to show their friend/partner/client the risks/benefits of investing

People visiting this website are looking for:
* Increased knowledge of trading cryptocurrencies
* A quick, easy way to invest in cryptocurrencies risk-free
* The potential profits/losses which could be made in the short and long-term
* An introduction to cryptocurrencies

Hashmoney is the ideal site for such people because:
* It includes all of the above in one place
* It has intuitive controls and layout
* It is both clear and concise in its layout
* The information it provides is kept to a minimum to avoid cognitive overload

## UX

**Strategy**

User needs:  simple to navigate, quick to register, straightforward to trade, intuitive design, unintimidating and modern appearance.

Being a cryptocurrency trader myself, I remember the uncertainty and skepticism I had before I began. With that in mind, I decided to write an app that would enable people to dip into cryptocurrency trading risk-free. Along with that, I wanted it to be straightforward with clear feedback as to how their portfolio was growing (or not, as the case may be). I also wanted to give people the confidence to be able to make mistakes and to start from scratch again without financial penalties, hence the 'reset portfolio' option.


**Scope**

User Stories:
1. As someone who is new to cryptocurrency trading, I want an app which gives me clear and concise information.
2. As someone who is new to cryptocurrency trading, I want an app which is intuitive to use.
3. As a person who is risk-averse, I want an app that allows me to trade cryptocurrencies without any financial investment.
4. As a person who wants to invest in cryptocurrencies, but still has reservations, I want an app that shows me the realistic gains and losses that can be made.


**Structure**

To make sure the content/functionality is intuitive to navigate, I maintained consistency throughout the different pages by using the same layout/structure (landing page sections matched the order of menu items) and header and footer elements.

On the landing and gallery pages, I used content hinting so that users would be encouraged to scroll further down the page.

**Skeleton**

To make sure the app is intuitive to navigate and use, I decided to keep all of the buttons options fairly centrally placed and slightly to the right-hand side. This is very important for mobile users they are predominantly right-handed and allows for one-handed operation of the app. By minimizing the amount of visual content past the landing page, I also reduced distraction and maximized engagement.

**Surface**

The 'Monserrat' Google font was chosen to give a clean and modern feel, while the white/grey/blue color scheme added to this style.

The color scheme was chosen as it feels sharp and modern to match the world of cryptocurrencies. At the same time, it is both visually unintimidating and easy on the eye. I wanted the app to have this look so that it appeals to users who are risk-averse and who don't want to be overloaded with unnecessary information. A shade of blue was chosen for the buttons as it is perceived as being a trustworthy, dependable, and responsible color. Blue is also popular among financial institutions, as conveys trust and stability. The button color is consistent throughout the app to maintain consistency and increase the intuitiveness of the page.

The cryptocoin hero image was chosen for the landing page to make it immediately apparent that this is a financial app dealing with cryptocurrency. The large two sentence message underneath the hero image was used to give a clear, unambiguous description of what the app is about.

The cryptocoin images used in the title bars of all other pages were used to maintain consistency and also reaffirm that it is an app dealing with cryptocurrency.

## Database


Having gone over my ideas for the database schema with my mentor Brian Macharia, the data was allocated across the following tables within a MongoDB database:

* Users - stores a user's personal information and undergoes CREATE, READ and UPDATE operations.
* Transactions - stores a user's transaction history has a many-to-one relation with the users table on the email address field. It undergoes CREATE, READ and DELETE operations.
* Balances - stores a user's current balances for each currency has a one-to-one relation with the users table on the email address field. It undergoes CREATE, READ and UPDATE operations.  
* Currencies - stores additional information about all of the cryptocurrencies and undergoes READ operations.

**Testing User Stories**

1. As someone who is new to cryptocurrency trading, I want an app which gives me clear and concise information.
* Yes, app presents all of the cryptocurrency names, logos and prices very clearly. There is also concise information about each one available to trade on the app.
2. As someone who is new to cryptocurrency trading, I want an app which is intuitive to use.
* Yes, it is very straightforward to trade on the app and users can also access all of their trades easily.
3. As a person who is risk-averse, I want an app that allows me to trade cryptocurrencies without any financial investment.
* Yes, it is clear from the home screen that the app is completely risk free. Once registered, users are allocated 100,000 USD credits which they use to buy and sell any of the listed cryptocurrencies they wish. They can also reset this balance and start from scratch at any point.
4. As a person who wants to invest in cryptocurrencies, but still has reservations, I want an app that shows me the realistic gains and losses that can be made.
* Yes, this is achieved by clearly showing a user's portfolio balance as well as an indication of how much it has grown or diminished since they started. 

**Testing Responsiveness**

The website was tested on various screen sizes using Chrome DevTools, from iPhone5 up to 5k screen. It was also tested using [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) and the results were as per the following image:

![Responsiveness](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/readme-assets/hashmoney_mockup.png "Responsiveness")


**Testing Browser Compatibility**

The website was successfully opened and rendered correctly in Chrome (both desktop and mobile versions), Edge and Safari.

**Code Validation**

Python code from the app.py file was checked using [Pep8online](https://www.pep8online.com)

The first check brought back numerous errors which were all rectified and resulted with a clear check as per the screenshot below.

![HTML](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/readme-assets/pep8_validation.png "Python")


HTML and CSS were validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. This was done using the 'Validate by Direct Input' option.

For the HTML, all pages except for the login page resulted in a warning caused by the flash messages section in the base.html template (see screenshot below). Having researched solutions on stackoverflow.com, I didn't change my code as the section already contained an h6 element as recommended by the warning (see below).

![HTML Section Warning](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/readme-assets/html_section_warning.png "HTML")

![Flash Section Code](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/readme-assets/flash_section_code.png "HTML")


The trade screen html threw up an interesting error relating to the select inputs:
![Trade screen error](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/readme-assets/trade_html_error.png "HTML")

This was fixed by adding a size property to the inputs and giving it a value of 18 which allows for the number of currencies options in the app.


The login page was the only one without any errors or warnings as it doesn't reference the flash message section in base.html:

![Login Page Checks](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/readme-assets/login_html_check.png "HTML")


All checks on the CSS file were clear on the first attempt as per screenshot below.

**Testing with Lighthouse in Google Chrome Devtools**

The results shown are for the homepage and portfolio pages on both mobile and desktop. These were chosen as they produced the lowest figures and best illustrate the gains made by implementing Lighthouse's recommended changes.

* Homepage (see images below): Running the test initially recommended changing the color of the copyright text to improve 'accessibility', add a meta description of the page to improve the 'SEO' and to resize of the 'Why Hash Money' image to improve the 'best practices' score. Having done all of these resulted in improvements across the board.

* Portfolio page (see images below): Running the test initially recommended changing the color of the copyright text to improve the 'accessibility' score (as it did for all pages) and to reduce the crypto logo file sizes to improve the 'performance' score. Results improved once these changes were implemented. However, there is still room for improvement with performance by using HTTP2 which is something I would look at doing in a future version.

**Notable bug fixes**

1. Portfolio Balance Bug 

In an early version of the app, the portfolio screen was showing a balance which multiplied the USD amount by twenty. This resulted in an incorrect balance. Having examined the code within the app.py file, I discovered that there was an error within the loop that iterates through a user's currency balances to produce the total balance (see screenshots below). By moving the totalBalance variable outside of the else statement (but still within the loop), the bug was fixed. In the screenshots, the left image is with the bug and the right image is after the fix had been applied. Line numbers are different from what they are in the final version as much more code has been added.

2. Heroku Deployment Bug

![Heroku Bug](https://johnroutledge.github.io/milestone-project-3/readme-assets/heroku_bug.png "Heroku Bug")

With the app not far from completion, I attempted to deploy it with Heroku. When trying to run the app, it produced the error is per the screenshot above. Having followed the onscreen instructions, I took a look at the application logs (shown below) and determined the error lay with importing requests. Having tried numerous suggestions from various webpages (which included freezing the requirements file) without success, I turned to tutor support for help. They also struggled, but suggested typing 'requests' directly into the requirements.txt file (see second image below). They also stated I did not have to include a version number. Having done this and then re-deploying on Heroku again, the app ran as expected.

3. Available Balance Bug

As a result of user testing, a bug was discovered in the flash message on the trade screen. It was displaying a zero available balance for DOGE when in reality, the balance was over 5000 USD. Having examined the code, the error was found in line 419 of app.py where additional number formatting was resulting in a balance being multiplied by zero. Removing the conversion to integer resulted in the correct format being applied. Running the fixed code confirmed the correct balance is now displayed in the flash message. See below images for all details:

## Deployment 


**Creation on GitHub**

1. Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
1. Create a new repository by clicking the green 'new' button and choose the Code Institute full template
1. Click on the green 'Gitpod' button to initiates a fresh workspace

Adding files to the Github repository is done as follows:

Type the following into the command line:

        git add .  
        git commit -m "this is what I have done"
        git push

Using the '.' will add all files to the repository staging area. Single files are added using file path names, i.e.: about.html or assets/images/hero.png.
Be clear and consistent with your commit comments - it's a good idea to use imperatives to explain your changes. 
Pushing moves your work from the staging area to your repository.


**Deploying to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)**

1. Go to your Gitpod CLI and create a requirements file by typing 'pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt' in the root directory.
1. Next, create the Procfile by typing 'echo web: python app.py > Procfile' into the CLI root directory.
1. Open this file and type the line 'web: python3 app.py'. Make sure you delete any blank lines at the bottom, then save the file.
1. Add, commit and push your newly created files to your Github repository.
1. Then, go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and create an account. 
1. After logging in, click on 'create new app'.
1. Select the closest region to your location and give the app a name.
1. Select 'GitHub' as the deployment method.
1. Within the GitHub profile, enter the name of the GitHub repository you want to deploy from and click 'search'.
1. Once Heroku has found the repository, click to connect the app.
1. Go to the 'settings' tab for the app and click 'Reveal Config Vars'.
1. Set the environment variables by entering key-value pairs (leaving out any inverted commas) so that they match those in your env.py file (see section below for further details).
1. Go back to the 'deploy' tab and make sure 'enable automatic deploys' from the 'main' branch are selected. 
1. Click 'deploy'.
1. Once deployed, your app is now runnable by clicking 'view'.
